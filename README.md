# Mask_Detection
A Mask Detection project using Python.

### About
Masks play a crucial role in protecting the health of individuals against respiratory diseases, as is one of the few precautions available for COVID-19 in the absence of immunization. With this dataset, it is possible to create a model to detect people wearing masks, not wearing them, or wearing masks improperly.

### Dataset
The dataset contains 3 folders labeled as to which class they belong to. 
The 3 classes are-
1- "with_mask"
2- "without_mask"
3- "mask_weared_incorrect"

Each folder holds 2994 images of people that belong to such a labeled class.
